### Prerequisites

1. A Lemon Slice Agent created on a paid plan
2. A Wix page on a premium account. Embedding custom Javascript is only vailable on Premium plans.

### Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get an embed code">
    Visit the Lemon Slice [agents platform](https://lemonslice.com/agents) to find your agent's embed widget. It should look something like this:

    ```javascript
    <lemon-slice-widget agent-id="AGENT_ID_HERE"></lemon-slice-widget>
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@lemonsliceai/lemon-slice-widget"></script>
    ```

    Copy this embed code.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add embed code to your site">
    1. [Go to Settings](https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Settings&title=Select%20a%20Site&autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/settings) in your site's dashboard. 
    2. Click Custom Code in the Advanced section. 
    3. Click **Add Custom Code** at the top right. 
    4. Configure how your code will run in this section.
       - Paste your embed code under "Paste the code snippet here:"
       - Choose a name that you'll remember
       - (Recommended) If you select **All pages** and select **Load code once**, every page on your site will have the Lemon Slice agent widget. Your agent will persist across multiple pages.
         - You may also choose certain pages to display your agent. We don't recommend this, as it will cause your agent to restart if you change pages. 
       - Select **Body-Start** for **Place Code** 
    5. Save and publish your changes.
